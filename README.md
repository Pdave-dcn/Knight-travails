# Chessboard Knight Path - README

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement the graph data structure to solve a real-world problem. The goal is to calculate the shortest path for a knight's movement on a chessboard from a starting position to a target position. The movement adheres to the knight's L-shaped rules in chess.

The project highlights the following concepts:

- Using breadth-first search (BFS) for pathfinding.
- Representing the chessboard as a graph.
- Traversing and animating the knight's movement step by step.
- Enhancing user interaction with DOM manipulation and animations.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project was to implement the **graph data structure** and apply graph traversal algorithms, particularly **breadth-first search (BFS)**, in a practical project.

## Features

- **Chessboard Generation**: Dynamically generates an 8x8 chessboard with alternating colors.
- **Knight Movement Simulation**: Calculates and animates the shortest path a knight takes from its starting position to a user-selected target square.
- **Path Tracing**: Highlights the path the knight follows during its journey.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the chessboard.
- **CSS**: For styling the chessboard and animations.
- **JavaScript**: For logic implementation, graph traversal, and DOM manipulation.

## Implementation Details

### Chessboard Setup

The chessboard is generated dynamically using a nested loop, creating 64 squares. Each square alternates between `white` and `black` to mimic a real chessboard. Each square is labeled with its position, stored as `data-row` and `data-col` attributes for easy reference.

### Knight's Pathfinding

The **knightMoves** function calculates the shortest path from a starting position to a target using:

1. **Graph Representation**: Each square is treated as a node in the graph.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: BFS ensures the shortest path is found efficiently.
3. **Validation**: Movement is restricted to the chessboard boundaries using a helper function `isValid`.

### Animation

The `animateKnightMovement` function animates the knight's movement across the path calculated by `knightMoves`. The knight's current square is updated, and previous squares are highlighted to trace the path.

### Path Highlighting

To enhance the user experience, each square in the knight's path is temporarily highlighted with a `trace` class, providing a visual trace of the knight's journey.

## How to Use

1. Open the project in a web browser.
2. Click on any square on the chessboard to set the knight's target position.
3. Watch the knight calculate and animate its movement to the target square, tracing its path along the way.

## Key Functions

- `knightMoves(start, target)`
  - Implements BFS to calculate the shortest path between two squares.
- `animateKnightMovement(path)`
  - Animates the knight's movement across the calculated path and highlights the traversed squares.
- `getIndexFromCoordinates(row, col)`
  - Converts row-column coordinates into the chessboard's 1D array index.
- `getKnightPosition()`
  - Retrieves the current position of the knight on the board.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Graph Traversal**: Implementing BFS for pathfinding provided insights into how graphs can model real-world problems.
2. **DOM Manipulation**: Learned how to dynamically create and update elements in the DOM.
3. **User Interaction**: Enhanced skills in designing interactive visual feedback for better user experience.

## Future Improvements

- Allow users to place the knight at any starting position.
- Enable dynamic resizing of the chessboard for boards larger than 8x8.
- Add additional chess pieces and implement their unique movement rules.
- Optimize the animation speed based on the path length.

## Conclusion

This project is a practical demonstration of applying graph data structures and traversal algorithms to solve a problem visually and interactively. It bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, providing a foundation for exploring more advanced pathfinding problems in various domains.
